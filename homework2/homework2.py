# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# Git is the underlying software that allows you to save code, github is an online platform that hosts and lets you access repositories, git bash is a tool for windows users to be able to work with git by using commands similar to unix systems.

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
# Terminal is the window that allows you to interract with your system, the command line is where you actually input your commands in the terminal.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# Both are command line interfaces, powershell is meant to interact with the windows system more directly, while git bash emulates a unix system for windows to let you work in the same way you would on mac or linux.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
# Python is the programming language, conda manages environments and lets you install packages, Anaconda distributes everything and lets you easily download conda, Jupyter, and popular libraries.

# 5) What is VS Code? 
# VS Code is a free code editor that can debug and write code.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
# Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab are web programming environments, Jupyter Notebook is more simple, only using one document. Jupyter Lab is more complicated and in depth, allowing multiple documents.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# ~ denotes your home file in the terminal

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# An absolute path gives the full file path from the top most directory, while a relative path simplifies and abbreviates this, but doesnt give a files full location information.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute: /Users/ericfridman/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
# Relative: ../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# rm ./ deletes the current directory

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add
# Begins tracking the added file for future comitting.
# git commit
# Commits all tracked files to a git repository
# git push
# Uploads the local git repository to a remote repository

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# git add . tracks the current directory and its children, while git add file only tracks a single specific file.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# Git status shows current files, which are and aren't committed. git log -1 shows the details of the latest change to a git repository

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# cloning creates a new, local copy of a repository, while pulling updates a local repository with changes from a linked remote repository.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
# I haven't had many serious errors in this class, but I've troubleshooted by googling my error to see what's wrong.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# Git as a concept still feels a bit fuzzy to me, but I understand how to work with it

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# Kangaroos aren't born in the pouch, they have to climb their way in as blind little leg-less jelly beans

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(5%2)
# 5 % 2 gives the remainder of 5/2.
